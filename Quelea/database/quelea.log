Wilt Thou not accept my prayer?\u000aLo! I sink, I faint, I fall - Lo! on Thee I cast my care;\u000aReach me out Thy gracious hand! While I of Thy strength receive,\u000aHoping against hope I stand, dying, and behold, I live.\u000a\u000aThou, O Christ, art all I want, more than all in Thee I find;\u000aRaise the fallen, cheer the faint, heal the sick, and lead the blind.\u000aJust and holy is Thy Name, I am all unrighteousness;\u000aFalse and full of sin I am; Thou art full of truth and grace.\u000a\u000aPlenteous grace with Thee is found, grace to cover all my sin;\u000aLet the healing streams abound; make and keep me pure within.\u000aThou of life the fountain art, freely let me take of Thee;\u000aSpring Thou up within my heart; rise to all eternity.',NULL)
